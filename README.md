Air pollution levels in India were impacted significantly by the COVID-19 lockdown implemented by the Government of India.A machine learning approach is used to forecast the AQI levels for the initial lockdown period of April to July 2020 using a SARIMAX model applied to monthly AQI data from Delhi. By comparing the predicted values with the actual resampled values for this period, an average difference of 30% is observed between the forecasted and actual AQI values. The findings in this paper demonstrate the usefulness of machine learning technologies for modeling and predicting the impact of restrictions on pollution levels, and provide valuable insights for policymakers and other stakeholders seeking to mitigate the environmental impacts of such measures.
